## Future Test

This project uses the Officient.io and Google's Directions APIs to provide real data for each employee registered in an Officient organization.

While in development, it uses an OAuth login connect to one specific account.
In production, in order to give access to 3rd party accounts, the app must be verified by Officient.io
